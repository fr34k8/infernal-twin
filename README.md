FAQ:
1) I have a problem with connecting to Database

Solution: 

There seem to be few issues with Database connectivity. The solution is to create a new user on the database and use that user for launching the tool. Follow the following steps. 

1. Delete dbconnect.conf file from the Infernalwireless folder

2.run the following command from your mysql console.

mysql>use mysql;

mysql> CREATE USER 'root2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'enter the new password here';

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \*.\* TO 'root2'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

3. Try to run the tool again.
